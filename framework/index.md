# Framework

## About
Welcome to **SOG's Mission Framework**.

This framework was inspired by and designed after **Malbryn's Mission Framework** to help the SOG Community's mission makers create complex PvE scenarios in ArmA 3.
Some of the scripts and functions from **MalFramework** have been integrated into the framework, and credit is given to their original authors.
